## Challenges
* Create a home panel to list users
* The information selected in the grid will only be: ID and Name.
* A screen must contain a search field that can be done by Name and Email.
* You can expand any line in the grid to access commonly used information: username, email, phone and city.
* When clicking on the selected line, redirect to the details screen.
* On details screen, display all the information for the selected user.
